# SignUpForm

This app is a simple test of 4 editText fields, in the guise of a mock sign up form.

When the "Save" button is clicks it initiates an if else statement tree that checks if the username field has text,
the email field has text, the password field has text, the confirm password field has text, and finally if 
the password and confirm passwords match.  If any field is blank a toast is displayed to inform the user.  If all fields
are filled and the password and confirm password match a successful tost is displayed.  The accompanying screenshot
is of a successful test.
